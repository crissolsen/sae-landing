    Sedgefield Academy of Excellence A new educational feather in the village's
    cap - The Sedgefield Academy of Excellence - with the vision to be a
    dynamic, future focused, innovative, respected institution which inspires a
    passion for learning.

    Marcia and Richard with Kids The academy is under the
    ownership of Marcia Caldecott and Richard Barthus and is the third
    educational facility that they have set up, the other two being in Kwazulu
    Natal. “We are not a school, we are a support centre for home-schooled
    children,” explains Marcia, a matric teacher of 16 years experience who is
    also qualified to teach learners with special needs. She says that they
    recognised a need for this support system in this area when they made
    enquiries via 'Sedge locals' and other social media platforms. The dual
    medium academy, situated at 30 Swallow Drive (corner Pelican) in Swan Lake
    Dance Studio premises Click for Directions, is registered with IMPAQ, but
    handles all the curriculums associated with home-schooling from Grade R to
    Matric.

    Children may register as full time or part time learners, or even
    simply for 'ad hoc' lessons as and when needed. “We can organise extra
    lessons in a particular subject for individuals or even small groups,” says
    Marcia, who shares her duties with another fully qualified teacher Natalie
    Etridge, the Grade R to Grade 6 teacher. It's all about giving children the
    individual, one on one attention they need, so that they do not get 'left
    behind' in their learning. Hence Marcia and Richard's plan to keep the
    number of learners enrolled to a maximum of thirty, and to bring in the
    services of other tutors should the need arise. “We want to bridge the gap
    between home-schooled children and those receiving standard school
    education,” the enthusiastic Marcia told us. “And in the future” adds
    Richard, “we are looking to providing scholarships for individuals who can't
    afford to pay for classes for kids, as well as offering internships for
    those studying teaching.”

    The couple and their two young girls have fallen
    in love with Sedgefield, and are determined to add value to the community.
    Richard, who handles the general admin, invigilating and the day to day
    running of the academy, is already a proud volunteer with both the
    neighbourhood watch and the Fire Rangers.
